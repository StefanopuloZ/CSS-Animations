# CSS Animations

### Project online using GitHub Pages **[here](https://stefanopuloz.github.io/CSS-Animations/)**

Single page app showcasing some of the capabilities CSS animations can do. 

Intro animation and bottom most animation are something I have put a lot of effort in to. Most of the rest are activated on hover and are just showcase examples.

## Technologies

Pure CSS and HTML. Flexbox has been used in this project.
